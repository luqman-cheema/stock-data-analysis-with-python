By employing requests and BeautifulSoup, the HTML content of the webpage is fetched and parsed to locate the revenue table. The table is processed into a pandas dataframe, where columns are renamed and the Revenue column is cleaned by removing special characters and handling missing values. This structured dataset allows for seamless analysis of Tesla's historical revenue trends, showcasing efficient data extraction and preparation methods for data analysts."
